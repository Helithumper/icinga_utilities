# Icinga Utilities

This is a compilation of utilities I found useful for managing and maintaining an Icinga2 instance for monitoring during CCDC practices and scrimmages. Included are scripts which I can use for configuration creation or scoring. Templates have been included for ease of creation for different services on the Icinga2 instance.

## Scripting

For the scripts, I have locally created a `credentials.ini` file which contains the credentials in use for the scripts. Here is the layout of said file.

```plaintext
[database]
username=REDACTED
password=REDACTED
db=icinga2
host=REDACTED
```
